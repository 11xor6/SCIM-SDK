# Contributing to SCIM-SDK

Contributing is kept simple:

1. Create an issue that describes the problem.
2. Create a pull-request
   1. Use clearly described commit messages in your changes
   2. Reference the issue in each commit message that will be part of the pull request
     
     Example:
     ```
     Fix parsing of null attributes
   
     fixes #999
     ```  
3. Add unit tests. This is to keep your changes alive and to prevent any future regressions.
